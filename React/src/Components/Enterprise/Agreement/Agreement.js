If you are a direct competitor of EsayClub, you may not register for the use of the Services without the express written consent of EsayClub.Trial period and account activation
EsayClub offers a free 30-day trial, which includes two modes
1. "Trial Period" - During the "Trial Period" you will not be able to generate real receipts. Receipts in the "trial period" will have the caption "trial" added. A number of features will not work during the "trial period", such as: (i) entering a custom receipt number, (ii) using credit cards, (iii) adding additional cash registers, and more.
2. "Active mode" - In this mode you can choose to activate your account at any time and will not be charged until the 30 days are over. Once your account has been activated (that is, after a valid credit card has been entered), all transactions and receipts created during the "trial period" will be automatically deleted. You can choose to delete the customers and inventory created during the "trial period". You can also cancel your appointment at any time and as long as the cancellation is made before the end of the 30-day "trial period", you will not be charged.
As stated, the trial period will begin immediately upon creation of the account and will last for 30 days. After 30 days, if no activation has taken place (ie no valid credit card has been entered), your account will be suspended. After the suspension you will not be able to access the system or retrieve your data, so be sure to export your data in advance before the end of the trial period.
Once your account is suspended you will have an additional 30 days to reactivate your account. Then, if no reactivation has taken place, your account will be permanently deleted along with all the information. In this case, the subdomain will be vacated and released for the benefit of other new users.</p>
